# COVID-19 Tracker ðŸ¦ 

iOS app to see COVID-19 statistics worldwide. It's built using the new *shiny~* âœ¨ `SwiftUI` framework with modern architecture as well as support to `Widgets` and custom `Intents`.


iOS app that mimics App Store's Today page custom transition. Built using UIKit framework without any third-party dependencies. I built this app inspired by Andrei Blaj's ([link to his profile](https://github.com/andrei-blaj))  implementation on the same topic but with my own take with added modification and changes to make it even more awesome ðŸ˜Ž.<br><br>
